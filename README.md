This is a fun bioinformatics practice designed for PBIO1140: Foundations of Plant Biology.  The objective of this practice is to introduce the importance of computaional programming in modern molecular biology studies.  The outcome of this practice is to allow you to be able to 1) find the sequence information of a protein coding gene on a bioinformatics website, 2) describe the differences among genomic sequence, cDNA sequence, coding sequence, and protein sequence of a gene, 3) compare the sizes of different databases and describe why they are different, and 4) connect to a bioinformatics server and run command codes on linux.
